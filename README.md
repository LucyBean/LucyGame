# LucyGame
My Java game project starring myself.

This project was started as a way of keeping myself entertained over my long commutes over the summer. I want my game to be a mix of a platformer and a hack and slash game, similar to Bayonetta.

I decided to use Slick2D as my starting point for my game. This essentially provides the window in which the game is shown, update and render methods, and an easy way to draw an image on the screen. I decided that I wanted to implement the game from scratch but I decided that using anything lower level would not be as fun!

A list of features in approximate order of implementation:
* The ability to check whether two rectangles overlap
* Actors that can move around the world and respond to keypresses
* A camera that can follow an Actor around the world
* A menu system
* Items that can be picked up and an inventory system
* Keys and locks
* A very basic quest system
* A level builder
* Animated sprites of myself walking/running/jumping/falling

Running world.LucyGame should run the game but I have not tested this on other computers.
