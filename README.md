# LucyGame
My Java game project starring myself.

This project was started as a way of keeping myself entertained over my long commutes over the summer. I want my game to be a mix of a platformer and a hack and slash game, similar to Bayonetta.

I decided to use Slick2D as my starting point for my game. This essentially provides the window in which the game is shown, update and render methods, and an easy way to draw an image on the screen. I decided that I wanted to implement the game from scratch but I decided that using anything lower level would not be as fun!

A list of features in approximate order of implementation:
* The ability to check whether two rectangles overlap
* Actors that can move around the world and respond to keypresses
* A camera that can follow an Actor around the world
* A menu system
* Items that can be picked up and an inventory system
* Keys and locks
* A very basic quest system
* A level builder
* Animated sprites of myself walking/running/jumping/falling
* A dog enemy (the world enemy in the world)
* The ability to climb up things, push blocks, and crouch
* The world contains trampolines and moving blocks

Running Demo/runLucyGame.jar will download and run the latest version of the demo. If you just want to play the game, download this file, put it in a folder, and run! (This will download all necessary files to a new directory called 'Lucy Game Alpha Demo' so you might want to put it in its own folder)
