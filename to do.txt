==  IDEAS  ==
=============

Build the game interface
	Make options saving automatic
	Make options file a little more human-readable.
		
Make interface drawing more efficient
	Every menu element image currently has its own image buffer, even though they share
	a background.
	
Interactions
	Allow an object to check if it is currently overlapping a certain object? Not sure if that would be necessary and may take up too much space.
