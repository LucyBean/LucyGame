====================
==  THINGS TO DO  ==
====================

Platformer moves

Add the ability to place climbing markers using the world builder

Add "object sticker" attachments. These can be added to objects and when
	other Actors (of a certain type only?) are within the "object sticker" they
	will move with that object

Add a pet that follows me

Expand the quest system
	Add a platformer tutorial quest
	Add a Matt quest

Animations
	Compile each animation folder to a single file

Sprite constructors: remove those that specify a Point?
=============
==  IDEAS  ==
=============

Tie Sprite to ItemType? E.g. when creating an object have to specify the ItemType
	and how to get the Sprite. Surely the type of Sprite can be specified from
	the ItemType.

Build the game interface
	Make options saving automatic
	Make options file a little more human-readable.
	
Interactions
	Allow an object to check if it is currently overlapping a certain object?
	Not sure if that would be necessary and may take up too much space.

Use high-quality sprites to facilitate zooming?
