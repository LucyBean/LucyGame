====================
==  THINGS TO DO  ==
====================

Add a pet that follows me
Add a Matt quest
	
Map sector object loading

Platformer moves

Animations
	Compile each animation folder to a single file

==============
==  ISSUES  ==
==============
Sprite constructors: remove those that specify a Point?

Why can the camera not zoom when it is tracking?

=============
==  IDEAS  ==
=============

Build the game interface
	Make options saving automatic
	Make options file a little more human-readable.
	
Interactions
	Allow an object to check if it is currently overlapping a certain object? Not sure if that would be necessary and may take up too much space.

Use high-quality sprites to facilitate zooming?
