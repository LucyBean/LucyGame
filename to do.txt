====================
==  THINGS TO DO  ==
====================

Platformer moves

Add the ability to place climbing markers using the world builder

Add a pet that follows me

Expand the quest system
	Add a platformer tutorial quest
	Add a Matt quest

==============
Sprite constructors: remove those that specify a Point?

=============
==  IDEAS  ==
=============

Change the format of the timings file for the animations as it is very difficult to remember
	what everything does. It is also not clear which numbers are for which animations.
	Change to something like:
		ANIMATION NAME:
			FPS:x
			LOOP:true/false

Build the game interface
	Make options saving automatic
	Make options file a little more human-readable.
	
Interactions
	Allow an object to check if it is currently overlapping a certain object?
	Not sure if that would be necessary and may take up too much space.

Use high-quality sprites to facilitate zooming?
