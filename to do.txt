==  THINGS TO DO  ==
====================

Change Object lists to sets

Creating other types of map objects (especially linked objects, like keys and switches)
	Unlocked lock sprite
	Build an inventory display
	Make the inventory persist across worlds?
	
Refactor World to include a Map object. This will be responsible for holding all the objects
in the world. A MapImporter class can then be built which will read a TiledMap from file and
produce a Map. As a minimum the Map is the set of WorldObject lists.

==  IDEAS  ==
=============

Build the game interface
	Make options saving automatic
	Make options file a little more human-readable.
		
Make interface drawing more efficient
	Every menu element image currently has its own image buffer, even though they share
	a background.
	
Interactions
	Allow an object to check if it is currently overlapping a certain object? Not sure if that would be necessary and may take up too much space.
