====================
==  THINGS TO DO  ==
====================

Platformer moves

Refactor RectangleImageStore to accept a colour in the constructor and make 'get'
automatically create or retrieve the correct rectangle.

A major refactor is in order.
	Remove reference to GameObject in Attachment constructor? Almost all seem to use null then
		assign the GameObject when it is attached to the GameObject.

Add a pet that follows me
Add a Matt quest

Animations
	Compile each animation folder to a single file

==============
==  ISSUES  ==
==============
Sprite constructors: remove those that specify a Point?

Why can the camera not zoom when it is tracking?

=============
==  IDEAS  ==
=============

Tie Sprite to ItemType? E.g. when creating an object have to specify the ItemType
	and how to get the Sprite. Surely the type of Sprite can be specified from
	the ItemType.

Build the game interface
	Make options saving automatic
	Make options file a little more human-readable.
	
Interactions
	Allow an object to check if it is currently overlapping a certain object?
	Not sure if that would be necessary and may take up too much space.

Use high-quality sprites to facilitate zooming?
