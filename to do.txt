====================
==  THINGS TO DO  ==
====================

Make InterfaceElements use a two-layer Sprite, one for background, one for text.
	Now need to make clicking work again!

Build the game interface
	Build a more flexible Menu system. Allow sub menus.
	Add a debug sub-menu that can modify options. Save options?
	
Make collider drawing more efficient
	Currently allocating buffer for every collider image drawn which is
	pretty slow. Change it to tile the collider image?

Camera following
	Make the camera following less choppy.

Interactions
	Allow an object to check if it is currently overlapping a certain object? Not sure if that would be necessary and may take up too much space.

Creating other types of map objects (especially linked objects, like keys and switches)

Map sector object loading

Platformer moves
